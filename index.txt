Addi Lewis - Section 03 - Dr. Eloe/10am

I am a senior Digital Media: Computer science student.

I am from Smithville Missouri and I am currently the teaching assistant for Web Development I. In the past, I have been the TA for programming 1 and 2. Over the summer I worked at Principal Financial in Des Moines as a Software Engineer working on digital benefits in Java and HTML. I am currently on the board for ACM and as of this year participating in Knacktive. My hobbies are video games and digital painting.

My career plans are to work in SEO and UX design or Web Development. Ideally combining them as a Full Stack Developer.
